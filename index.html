                    <h2>The Frame</h2>
                    <p>I really wanted to take apart an old frame and build it back up again from scratch so that I could learn how bikes work. I decided to go with an old Peugeot bike frame that I found on Facebook Marketplace. It was in really bad shape when I got it and looked like it had been stored outside. All the components were rusty or stuck in place.I disassembled all of the components and tried using enamel paint to cover all the rust spots. When that didn't work, I <em>learned to powdercoat</em> (which I'm really proud of!) and ultimately updated the color and decals to something entirely new.<div>Turns out, though, I accidently bought a vintage mountain bike frame, rather than a vintage road bike frame, which has led to some interesting developments as I started to add new components.</div>

                    <h2>The Wheels</h2>
                    <p>Turns out, if you really want to invest in something on a custom build, you should invest in your wheelset. If these are good quality, it will greatly impact your quality of life while cycling. I wanted to install 700C wheels on my bike, but with the mountain vs. roadbike frame, I had to use 26" wheels instead, since the frame was too small to accommodate 700C wheels. <a>insert hyperlink here about the difference between 700C and 26" wheels</a> My friend recommended this website: <a>insert hyperlink to proWheelBuilders</a>, but I ended up going with my local bike shop. The bike shop is currently building my wheels, but I'm so excited to see them when they're done!

                    <h2>The Brakes</h2>
                    <p>There are so many things that have taken a different turn than the original vision in this project, and the brakes are one of them. My first choice was disc brakes, but vintage frames can't accommodate those, so then I thought I could do caliper brakes. Turns out, those are frame-specific too, and my frame could only use V-Brakes or cantilever breaks. I decided to use cantilever brakes because I think they look cool and geometric. I also got these awesome brake cable holders, which I'm very excited to install!</p>

                    <h2>The Handlbars and Cockpit</h2>
                    <p> I really love dreaming about the cockpit and handlebars because it's where your aesthetic really comes in. There's so many options of where to install your gear shifters (which I ultimately won't have because I decided to go with a single-speed anyway). But, I finally decided on drop handlebars, which look so good on a vintage mountain bike. <a>insert hyperlink to dirt drop instagram</a> Originally, I was going for a teal/leather brown color scheme, which looks so great on old Bianchi road bikes, but after revising my vision to accommodate the mountain bike, I thought teal and blue would be really cool.</p>

                    <h2>The Drivetrain</h2>
                    <p>This is definitely the part of the build that I needed the most help with. Bottom brackets are so hard!<a>(insert link to that one diagram that North used)</a> Also, there's a lot of ratios and decision making that goes into how many gears you need. I wanted a 1 by 10 drivetrain, but found out my rear fork was too narrow to add a cassette with 10 speeds, and that a single-speed would be the cheapest and simplest way to go. I will miss learning about a derailleur as I rebuild this bike, but maybe on my next rebuild? In the meantime, check out this awesome floral patterned crankset I bought from a vintage dealer on ebay!</p>

                    <h2>The Details</h2>
                    <p> I also really loved dreaming about the saddle for the bike. This works with the handlebars to bring out the aesthetic you're going for. I thought I would go for a brown leather saddle, but as I was building this bike, I kept coming back to this one. It's all-weather, and such a pretty blue!</p>
